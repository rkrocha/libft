## About The Project

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.

## Built With

Pure C.

## Prerequisites

* A Shell terminal
* gcc compiler
* make command

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rkrocha/libft.git
```

2. Compile the library

```sh
make
```

## Usage

1. Include the libft header in your program:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

2. Call the functions you wish to use in your program, and compile it as such:

```sh
gcc <your_program>.c -I<path/to/libft_folder> -L<path/to/libft_folder> -lft
```
